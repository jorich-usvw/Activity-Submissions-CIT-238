KOTLIN:
Kotlin is a moderm programming language, a safer alternative to Java, which was previously the preferred programming language for mobile application development.

Compared to Java, Kotlin is better in terms of:

1. Consciseness - less code, more readable and reduced development time

2. Safety - in terms of crashing because of NPE (NullPointerException)

3. Interoperability - Kotlin source codes can coexist together with Java source codes.

4. Multiplatform - similar with Dart (Flutter), Kotlin can be used to develop applications for other platforms.

Note:
1. For testing the kotlin program above, you can either run it in Android Studio OR you can run them in the Kotlin Playground
